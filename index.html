            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a recent graduate from Concordia University's John Molson School of Business, where I specialized in Finance and Data Intelligence. 
                I believe we are at the brink of a technological revolution, much like the rise of the internet, and AI is at the forefront of this transformation. 
                My passion lies in understanding how AI is reshaping industries, economies, and businesses—and using my knowledge to navigate this evolving landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong foundation in financial modeling, valuation, forecasting, and risk assessment, I have applied my skills in data analysis 
                and automation using tools like Excel, Power BI, SAP, SQL, and VBA Macros. My experience at BRP strengthened my ability to manage large 
                datasets, streamline reporting, and develop automation tools that enhanced efficiency by over 70%.
            </p>
            <p>
                My long-term goal is to work in Investment Banking or M&A, gaining firsthand experience in how corporations rise, grow, mature, and pivot 
                in a competitive market. As a side project, I am working on a DCF valuation tool that utilizes AI-powered OCR technology to extract financial 
                data and calculate intrinsic value based on user-defined parameters. Additionally, I am developing an AI Market Trend Tracker, which analyzes 
                the historical impact of AI across various industries—technology, healthcare, defense, agriculture, and education—to assess investment opportunities. 
                These projects embody my curiosity, my drive to innovate, and my vision for the intersection of finance and technology.
