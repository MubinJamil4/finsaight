            <p>
                I am a recent graduate from Concordia University's John Molson School of Business, where I specialized in Finance and Data Intelligence. 
                I believe we are at the brink of a technological revolution, much like the rise of the internet, and AI is at the forefront of this transformation. 
                My passion lies in understanding how AI is reshaping industries, economies, and businessesâ€”and using my knowledge to navigate this evolving landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong foundation in financial modeling, valuation, forecasting, and risk assessment, I have applied my skills in data analysis 
                and automation using tools like Excel, Power BI, SAP, SQL, and VBA Macros. My experience at BRP strengthened my ability to manage large 
                datasets, streamline reporting, and develop automation tools that enhanced efficiency by over 70%.
